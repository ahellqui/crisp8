This project contains the backend of a chip-8 emulator. It serves no real purpose by itself, but is made to allow different frontends to be written. The project takes a binary file and exposes a few functions to execute instructions or provide internal information of the emulated machine. It is up to the frontend to:
    - Print to the screen 
    - Supply callbacks for input and audio
    - Do the looping
